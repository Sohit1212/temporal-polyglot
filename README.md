# Polyglot Example

One of the benefits of Temporal is that it provides SDKs for several
languages and you can use multiple languages in the context of a single
Workflow. For example, you might write your Workflow in Java but use
Python or TypeScript for an Activity in that workflow. 

This example demonstrates a Workflow interface and implementation that executes
an Activity called `PythonHelloWorld`.
